# Managed Identity Wallets Utility Scripts

The Managed Identity Wallet is a secure and decentralized way to manage digital identities and credentials. It is used
to securely store and manage sensitive information such as personal identification, medical records, and financial data.

The Managed Identity Wallet Utility Scripts provide a set of tools to help manage and maintain the wallet. This
repository includes scripts for initializing and duplicating data within the wallet. For more information on how to use
these scripts, please refer to the individual README files in the initialization and duplication directories.
